                                         Set A
   Attempt any two.
1. Write a code in java to print a message before the main method runs.Also create a 1-D
   array of integers and print the values using extended for loop.  
2. Java under the hood uses virtual function implementation to provide by default dynamic
   polymorphism.Write a code in java to prevent this dynamic behaviour.
3. Create an abstract class Racer with following features:
    String racerName;
    String team;
    int salary;
    void displayTeam();
    abstract void increaseSalary();//display salary
   Now create two classes gradeA_Racer and gradeB_Racer that inherits from Racer class 
   and implement the method increaseSalary based on formula:
   For gradeA_Racer: new_salary= old_salary+30% of oldSalary;
   For gradeB_Racer: new_salary= old_salary+20% of oldSalary;
   Display salaries of both type of players after the respective increase.
                                       
                                         Set B
1. Write a code in java to show use of super and this keywords.
2. Suppose A is parent class of another class B.Then we define a method   
    thisWillBeCalledFromParent in both the classes.Then we create an object of class B
    and use a variable of type A to refer to that object.Now write a code in java such that
    parent class method is invoked rather than from child class.
3. create an interface Iperforer such that it contains method 
    void bonusToEmployee();
    Now create a class Employee that contains following information:
    String name;
    String Department;
    int salary;
    void displayDepartment();//to display department information
    now inherit this class in class ClericalStaff and implement bonusToEmployee() method
     of interface according to formula:
     bonus= 25% of salary+ 2500 rupees;
     you can keep bonus variable and showBonus() method as you want.
     Display bonus of ClericalStaff.
